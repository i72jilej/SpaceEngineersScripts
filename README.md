# SpaceEngineersScripts
A collection of my Space Engineers scripts developed using MDK-SE (Malware's Development Kit for SE, https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE). 

#### SimpleEnergyDisplay  
Shows on an LCD the percentage of remaining energy in a battery group and if it is being drained or recharged.  

Planned features:  
- Being able to manage different battery groups with the same Programmable Block.
- Being able to customize the LCD output.
